# Hybrid'agrume

## Overview

This project was given to us by the Hybrid'agrume compagny.

The Hybrid'agrume compagny makes fruits hybrids (the science of combining two existing fruits in order to create a better one).

This compagny contacted us because they were done using an excel file to reference all their hybridations, and wanted to instead use a database, which is much simpler for them to use. Our task was to develop the back-end side of the application, while the front-end side is managed by a front-end developper.

This project is intended to play with database build with postgreSQL.
The API was built with express and the connection was made with knex.
